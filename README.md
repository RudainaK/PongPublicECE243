# Description
My partner [Joel Lotzkar](https://github.com/jlotzkar) and I chose to recreate Pong for our final ECE243 project. The game was written in C to work on the De1-SoC board using a VGA display and ps/2 keyboard. It can also work the [CPUlator](https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm-de1soc) simulator. Unfortunately we are requested by the course to not distribute our code, but I'd be happy to discuss it with anyone curious. However, photos of what the game looks like and how it works are described below.
